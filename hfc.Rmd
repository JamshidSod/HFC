## Analytical Hierarchy Process in R

Four parameters such as Speed, Safety, Environment and Riding Quality were used to assign
importance weight to each highway functional classification namely, arterial, collector and local.     

First we need to load libraries:
```{r}
library(ahp)
library(data.tree)
```

Then we load input file hfc.ahp and look to the file:
```{r}
ahpFile <- system.file("extdata", "hfc.ahp", package="ahp")
cat(readChar(ahpFile, file.info(ahpFile)$size))
```
Next is to calculate priorities (eigenvalues) and visualize our data
```{r}
hfcAhp <- Load(ahpFile)
Calculate(hfcAhp)
Visualize(hfcAhp)
```
And finally is to present resuls in table
```{r}
AnalyzeTable(hfcAhp)
```




P.S. Analysis were done in RStudio, Version 0.99.902 (R version 3.3.0). OS - MAC
